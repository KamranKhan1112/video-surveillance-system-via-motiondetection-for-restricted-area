# Video Surveillance System via Motion Detection for Restricted Area’s

# Introduction:

In today’s competitive environment, the security concerns have grown tremendously.
The current systems used in the fight against thefts and destruction are the video surveillance and monitoring. By using the technologies, it is possible to monitor and capture every inch and second of the area in interest. The current systems only store the video with out any automated process and can’t alerting the concerned authorities while any unusual activities takes palce.Therefore, we have developed a methodology to detect the motion in a video stream environment and store those frames in which motion is detected as a video and picture in local storage as well as on online storage.The proposed system also give an alert to the concerned authorities.
This is an idea to ensure that the monitoring systems not only actively participate in stopping the unusual activities, but do so while such activities taking place. We used  Gaussian mixture-based background/ foreground segmentation algorithm. The process is simple, when an intruder enters the frame the algorithm will process and a tracking line will be formed around an intruder.Hence the system will not only detect the unusual activities but also store those frames plus alerting the concerned authorities.The redundant imaging techniques are excluded in the proposed system in order to minimize the computation time, which ultimately shorten the delay for a real-time implementation. This system will promote low delay but high performance real-time surveillance system.


# Project Aim:

*	The main objective of this project is to improve the security system in sensitive and restricted areas. <br />
*	To avoid unusual activities in sensitive areas. <br />
* To provide sufficient tools to the security authorities to eliminate security risks. <br />
* To detect motion in remote areas where human access is difficult. <br />
* To alert the concerned authorities incase of detection of unusual activity. <br />
*	Will take pictures when detecting motion and unusual activity. <br />
*	Notification will be sent to the concerned authorities when a motion is detected. <br />
**In our project, we have aimed to build such a surveillance system, which can not only detect motion but will also:** <br />
*	Warn the user of the intrusion. <br />
*	Record the footage of the video from the moment the motion was detected. <br />
*	Send Notification to the user when the Motion is Detected. <br />
