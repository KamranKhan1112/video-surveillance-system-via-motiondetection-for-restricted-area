# Video Surveillance System via Motion Detection for Restricted Area’s
Objective: To develop Motion Detecting -based alert system when trespassers intrude. Methods: Background subtraction is applied here so that we can detect the motion. In this method, we subtract the present frame from the previous frame which results in the movement or motion as the difference. Using Python as a platform, a frame window can be generated through which the principle can be applied. Findings: In modern era, surveillance is playing an optimum role and has been evolved as a need for industries, companies, shopping malls and even for homes which serves as a security purpose. This project deals with a conventional automatic surveillance system which can be applied without heavy complexity. By this facility, user can know the information even though he is located somewhere else. From the results obtained, one can observe even a small movement effectively from the captured area. Application/Improvement: The proposed model is feasible with minimum maintenance cost. Just An online data storing account which can be accessed from anywhere is enough. Mobile alert can be an alternative.

#Project Aim
The main objective of this project is to improve the security system in sensitive and restricted areas.
	To avoid unusual activities in sensitive areas.
	To provide sufficient tools to the security authorities to eliminate security risks.
	To detect motion in remote areas where human access is difficult.
	To alert the concerned authorities incase of detection of unusual activity.
	Will take pictures when detecting motion and unusual activity.
	Notification will be sent to the concerned authorities when a motion is detected.
Aim: In our project, we have aimed to build such a surveillance system, which can not only detect motion but will also:
•	Warn the user of the intrusion.
•	Record the footage of the video from the moment the motion was detected.
•	Send Notification to the user when the Motion is Detected.
