# Automated videosurveillance system-via-motion detection
Objective: To develop Motion Detecting -based alert system when trespassers intrude. Methods: Background subtraction is applied here so that we can detect the motion. In this method, we subtract the present frame from the previous frame which results in the movement or motion as the difference. Using Python as a platform, a frame window can be generated through which the principle can be applied. Findings: In modern era, surveillance is playing an optimum role and has been evolved as a need for industries, companies, shopping malls and even for homes which serves as a security purpose. This project deals with a conventional automatic surveillance system which can be applied without heavy complexity. By this facility, user can know the information even though he is located somewhere else. From the results obtained, one can observe even a small movement effectively from the captured area. Application/Improvement: The proposed model is feasible with minimum maintenance cost. Just An online data storing account which can be accessed from anywhere is enough. Mobile alert can be an alternative.
